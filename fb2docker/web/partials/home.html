  <h1>B2Docker Fedora Remix</h1>
  <blockquote>A fast moving, minimized operating system acting as a
    <a href="http://www.docker.io/">Docker</a> host.</blockquote>
  <img src="fedora-remix.png">
  <h3>Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Tracking latest Docker builds and testing</li>
    <li>Built using Fedora RPM technology on the server side for a
      known base, but
      with <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Projects/OSTree">OSTree</a>
      on the client side for <i>fully atomic</i> upgrades.
    </li>
    <li>SELinux security for Docker container isolation</li>
    <li>A familiar Unix environment, with a writable <tt>etc</tt></li>
    <li>The ability to choose between multiple variant trees, with
        additional RPM content.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Installation (Prepared VMs)</h3>
  <p>Automatically generated disk images (several times a day)
    are <a href="/images/auto/">available here</a>.  See
    the <a href="/images/releases/">releases</a> directory for known
    tagged releases.</p>
  <p>Vagrant: (Coming Soon)</p>
  <p>Log in as <tt>root</tt>, there is no password.  Inside the
    system, use <tt>ostree admin upgrade</tt> to download the latest
    code, and then <tt>reboot</tt>.  Upgrades
    are <a href="https://github.com/cgwalters/rpm-ostree/commit/ad46ed72f9ab3053b54f63d4dab87160dcb85866">GPG
    signed</a> for security.
  </p>
  <h3>Installation (Inside existing Fedora 20/EL 7 Beta)</h3>
  <p>A unique ability of OSTree is to safely parallel install
     operating systems into the new <tt>/ostree</tt> directory.  This
     will work on at least Fedora 20, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
     Beta.  First, ensure you have OSTree 2014.1 or newer.</p>
  <pre>
    yum install ostree
    ostree admin os-init fb2docker
    ostree remote add --set=gpg-verify=false fb2docker http://209.132.179.157/repo
    ostree pull fb2docker fb2docker/20/x86_64/buildmaster/core/docker
    ostree admin deploy --os=fb2docker fb2docker:fb2docker/20/x86_64/buildmaster/core/docker
    cp /etc/fstab /ostree/deploy/fb2docker/current/etc
  </pre>

  <h3>Source code</h3>
  <p>This project uses <a href="https://github.com/cgwalters/rpm-ostree">rpm-ostree</a> to 
    place RPMs in an OSTree repository.  The contents of each tree are located in
    <tt>/usr/share/rpm-manifest.txt</tt>, and most RPMs (and SRPMs)
    are provided by the Fedora project.  Some components are located
    in
    the <a href="http://copr-fe.cloud.fedoraproject.org/coprs/walters/rpm-ostree/">walters/rpm-ostree
    COPR</a> and
    the <a href="http://copr-fe.cloud.fedoraproject.org/coprs/walters/core-docker/">walters/core-docker
    COPR</a>.  All source code written for this project
    is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free
    Software</a>.</p>
