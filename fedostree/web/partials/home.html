  <p>An instance
    of <a href="https://github.com/cgwalters/rpm-ostree">rpm-ostree</a>
    for Fedora.  This project takes multiple RPM package sets from
    Fedora, assembles them on the build server side, and stores
    these trees in an OSTree repository.  Client systems can them
    atomically upgrade and switch between these trees.
