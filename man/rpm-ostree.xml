    <title>Description</title>

    <para>
      rpm-ostree is a system software management tool that
      combines features of both traditional RPM and
      OSTree.  At the moment, there are only two available
      commands: <literal>upgrade</literal> and
      <literal>rollback</literal>.
    </para>

    <para>
      On an rpm-ostree managed system, the traditional
      <literal>yum</literal> and <literal>rpm</literal>
      tools operate in a read-only state.  Instead, the
      underlying OSTree layer replicates a filesystem tree
      from a compose server.  In this "pure replication"
      model, there is no dependency resolution on the
      client machines, nor any ability to add or remove
      packages.

        <listitem><para>Download the latest
        version of the current tree, and
        deploy it, setting it up as the
        default for the next boot.  By design,
        this has no effect on your running
        filesystem tree.  You must reboot for
        any changes to take
